[**Iron Growers**](https://legacy.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/iron-growers) is mod dedicated to ease plants cultivating using 5 tiers of growers: copper, iron, gold, diamond and netherite. They decrease time needed for plants withing 4 blocks to grow and also act as water making farmlands within same 4 blocks moisturized. Pretty simple, isn't it?
