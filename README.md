[**Iron Growers**](https://legacy.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/iron-growers) mod is dedicated to ease plants cultivating using 5 tiers of growers: copper, iron, gold, diamond and netherite. They decrease time needed for plants within 4 blocks on the same altitude to grow and also act as water making farmlands within same 4 blocks moisturized and allowing sugar cane to be placed nearby. Pretty simple, isn't it?
